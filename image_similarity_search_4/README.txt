CSI-2120-Programming-Paradigms

This directory has been implemented by Matin Mobini (300283854) and Michael Massaad (300293612) for the 4th deliverable for the project of the course CSI2120A.
This submission includes this file (README.txt), as well as subdirectories imageDataset2_15_20 and queryImages, the project24.pl file and the 
CSI_2120_Project_Part4_MatinMobini_MichaelMassaad_300293612_300283854.pdf file containing the outputs and references of this project.

During the implementation, we consulted the lecture notes of the course, as well as the following sources:
- Prolog -- ATOMIC_LIST_CONCAT/3.SWI. (2020, July 19). https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=atomic_list_concat%2F3
- Prolog -- Function Min/2.SWI. (2021, June 10). https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?function=min%2F2
